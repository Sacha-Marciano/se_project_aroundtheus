# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is my 3rd project. It combines everything I learned from the past two projects and is the first project I build entirely from scratch (and a figma brief)

## Updates

Old to new:

- "Initial commit": The files were upload to a git repo and cloned localy
- "Desktop structure": HTML structure was built and styles for desktop viewport created.
- "Tablet and phone browser support": Page was styled according to figma brief for phone and tablet viewports
- "Self revision and README.md": Revision of the code and fixing of details, creation of the README.md file
